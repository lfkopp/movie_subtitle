{2044}{2140}Tension that had been brewing for|months in Nigeria exploded yesterday...
{2144}{2245}...as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu|orchestrated a swift and violent coup...
{2249}{2354}...against the democratically elected|government of President Samuel Azuka.
{2358}{2460}In the land with 1 20 million people|and over 250 ethnic groups...
{2464}{2530}...there'd been a long history|of ethnic enmity...
{2534}{2643}...particularly between northern Fulani|Moslems and southern Christian Ibo.
{2662}{2723}The victorious Fulani rebels|have taken to the streets...
{2728}{2814}...as outbursts of violence|continue all over the country.
{2832}{2939}Thousands have been killed in|the fighting or executed thereafter.
{2944}{3034}Fearing ethnic cleansing, most Ibo|have abandoned their homes...
{3038}{3142}...and are fleeing the city or searching|for sanctuary wherever they may find it.
{3146}{3224}Gen. Yakubu has taken control|of most of the country...
{3228}{3270}...and appears firmly in charge.
{3274}{3344}There's no word on the United Nations'|reaction to the coup...
{3348}{3443}...but United States forces have already|begun to evacuate its embassy.
{3872}{3953}As you can see behind me,|on the USS Harry S. Truman...
{3960}{4089}...activity is high as foreign nationals|are evacuated from all over Nigeria.
{4093}{4131}This once peaceful country...
{4136}{4245}...has been rocked by a series of ethnic|unrests and brief but bitter battles...
{4250}{4328}...mainly over control|of Nigeria's vast oil supply.
{4337}{4388}However, nothing can prepare|the country...
{4393}{4500}...for the overwhelming and decisive|action that has just taken place.
{4568}{4653}We have just heard|that the entire presidential family...
{4657}{4712}...has been assassinated.|l repeat:
{4716}{4803}The entire presidential family|has been assassinated.
{5221}{5264}-Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador.|-Thank you.
{5268}{5304}Let me take those for you.
{5313}{5357}He got one in the leg!
{5379}{5432}Put him in the sickbay now!
{5532}{5568}Well, look at you.
{5572}{5614}-Welcome back.|-Thank you.
{5642}{5739}We appreciate you've been humping out|there, but we have to put you back in.
{5751}{5862}Priority tasking. We need to extract|a critical personality ASAP.
{5868}{5948}Now get some chow,|refit for a three-day LLRP.
{5959}{6024}See you in chow to debrief.|You...
{6032}{6091}-...go see the medic.|-Aye, captain.
{6311}{6343}Attention on deck.
{6347}{6408}As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.
{6536}{6567}Everybody get chow?
{6571}{6623}-Yes, sir.|-Okay.
{6627}{6727}Now, intel estimates|5000 Yakubu troops...
{6732}{6756}...scattered throughout this sector.
{6795}{6840}They've captured|government armories...
{6844}{6943}...and unfortunately, we have been|supplying them for far too many years.
{6966}{7115}ln addition, the local militia are killing|anyone who goes to a different church.
{7120}{7206}All right, now, your prime objective|is to find and extract...
{7211}{7322}...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with|lnternational Relief Services.
{7330}{7388}Dr. Kendricks is an American|by marriage.
{7394}{7466}Her late husband|was Dr. John Kendricks.
{7470}{7504}Your secondary objective...
{7508}{7591}...is to extract two nuns and a priest|who run a feel-good near Yolingo...
{7596}{7642}...if they so choose to leave.
{7646}{7703}St. Michael's Mission, right here.
{7708}{7750}You will halo over Cameroon...
{7754}{7837}...and float into your DZ near the edge|of the Mazon Rain Forest.
{7841}{7871}When you get your package...
{7875}{7974}...you will proceed|to your extract LZ Alpha.
{7979}{8074}Our presence on the ground|will be considered hostile.
{8108}{8149}-Questions?|-Sir...
{8153}{8180}...rules of engagement?
{8184}{8288}You will defend yourselves if you're|fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.
{8294}{8339}Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion|plan?
{8344}{8426}Patrol the Cameroon border|through the Tandjile Pass.
{8446}{8494}Anything else, gentlemen?
{8562}{8586}All right.
{8614}{8638}Dismissed.
{8908}{8950}Gentlemen, three minutes out.
{11304}{11339}lt's okay. lt's okay.

{11406}{11466}Good. Good.|l'm not gonna hurt you.
{11499}{11566}Are there any soldiers here?|Any rebel soldiers?
{11570}{11626}You sure? You sure?
{11631}{11705}Good. Good. Can you take me|to Dr. Lena Kendricks?
{11709}{11756}Do you know who she is?|Okay, here we go.
{11760}{11808}Nice and easy. Come on.
{11818}{11858}Zee, we're moving.
{11864}{11930}lt's all right. l'm not gonna|hurt you, okay?

{12499}{12523}Clear.
{13132}{13162}Lasana, where's that wa--?
{13166}{13216}These American men are here|to see you!
{13222}{13319}l'm Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy.|l'm here to get you and your people out.
{13331}{13378}We're in the middle of surgery here.
{13382}{13436}Ma'am, you don't realize|what's about to happen here.
{13440}{13484}Are you a nun?|Are you one of the nuns?
{13489}{13522}-Are you a nun, ma'am?|-Yes, sir.
{13526}{13599}Good. Pack your things|and let's get out of here now.
{13604}{13627}-Lieutenant!|-Ma'am.
{13648}{13739}Get those weapons out|of my operating room.
{13744}{13783}You're frightening my staff.
{13795}{13899}l'll be with you when l'm done.|Now please wait outside!
{13904}{13948}Your staff should be frightened,|ma'am.
{13952}{14033}Do you know what'll happen to you|and these women when rebels get here?
{14160}{14208}Doc, maybe you can help her out.
{14213}{14263}Ma'am, may l assist?
{14284}{14330}-Are you a doctor?|-No, l'm a corpsman, ma'am.
{14342}{14384}-Can you stitch?|-Yes, ma'am.
{14390}{14438}-Are you sure?|-Yeah, he's sure.
{14518}{14548}Then close for me.
{14592}{14638}We're taking our good old time here.
{14756}{14822}All right, Lt. Waters, l'm all yours.
{14900}{14926}Hurry up, Doc.
{15040}{15106}l assume you have a plan|to get us all out of here?
{15110}{15156}Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.
{15160}{15240}We've got a 1 2-klick hike to make|to rendezvous to the helicopter.
{15246}{15298}Get your things together,|but pack light.
{15330}{15418}Zee, bring your perimeter up.|Keep Flea in place.
{15423}{15488}We spotted a rebel company|outside of Yolingo on the way in.
{15492}{15558}We must assume they'll be here|by night, if not sooner.
{15562}{15656}l'm responsible for 70 people here, more|than half of them seriously wounded.
{15660}{15728}My orders are to evacuate|foreign nationals only, ma'am.
{15732}{15770}What does that mean?
{15774}{15830}l mean nonindigenous personnel,|ma'am.
{15834}{15864}Then we have a problem.
{15868}{15978}l will not leave without|the indigenous personnel.
{15982}{16079}We're here to get you out.|Now, l suggest you go find the priest...
{16084}{16152}...go find the nuns, pack your things|and prepare to move.
{16156}{16262}When the rebel troops get here,|they'll kill everything they see...
{16266}{16314}...including privileged white doctors.
{16318}{16394}-What part of that plan don't you get?|-The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!
{16399}{16475}-You could fly them out in 30 minutes!|-Can't do that.
{16479}{16524}-Why not?|-Because my orders are very clear:
{16528}{16640}Evacuate the priest, you and the two|nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.
{16644}{16698}We can take those who can walk.
{16702}{16770}They're not my responsibility.|You are my responsibility.
{16934}{16986}You're right, lieutenant...
{16992}{17072}...it's not your problem.|lt is my responsibility...
{17076}{17142}...and l will not leave|without my people.
{17320}{17352}All right, give me a minute.
{17383}{17418}-A minute?|-That's right.
{17431}{17539}Sixty seconds. l suggest you use|that time to go find the priest.
{17648}{17705}Get Command on the horn.
{17715}{17743}Eagle One to Command.
{17747}{17814}-Lena, what's going on?|-l don't know yet.
{17818}{17864}Eagle One to Command.
{17968}{18002}Eagle One.
{18024}{18067}Yeah, captain, we got a problem.
{18071}{18096}No, we got her.
{18111}{18190}But she wants to bring the 70 people|here along with her.
{18226}{18264}Yes, sir, l understand.
{18271}{18307}l will handle it.
{18315}{18346}Eagle One, out.
{18582}{18622}Dr. Kendricks.
{18776}{18864}You win. Get your people together.|We leave in a half an hour.
{18868}{18920}There will be helicopters for them too?
{18932}{19006}Yes. We can only take those who can|move under their own power.
{19030}{19070}l understand.
{19090}{19116}Thank you, lieutenant.
{19123}{19163}Hurry, please.
{19363}{19434}Why don't we just get Doc|to trang her the fuck out?
{19438}{19524}That's a great idea, Red. Drugging|and kidnapping an American doctor.
{19529}{19577}l ain't sure this bitch is American.
{19600}{19674}The doctor is the mission, Red.|Stick with her.
{19704}{19784}-And we're taking all these people out?|-Go on.
{19848}{19911}We need everyone able|to travel ready to go.
{19916}{19975}We must leave guickly.|Quickly!
{19980}{20029}God will bless you, Lena.
