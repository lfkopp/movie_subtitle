{1161}{1287}Some people hear their own|inner voices with great cleamess.
{1291}{1367}And they live by what they hear.
{1371}{1521}Such people become crazy,|or they become legends ...
{1675}{1792}Tristan Ludlow was bom|in the moon of the falling leaves.
{1796}{1855}lt was a terrible winter.
{1861}{2012}His mother almost died|bringing him into this world.
{2075}{2166}His father, the Colonel,|brought him to me.
{2170}{2327}l wrapped him in a bear skin|and held him all that night.
{2341}{2468}As he grew into a man,|l taught him thejoy of the kill.
{2483}{2608}When the hunter|cuts out its warm heart. -
{2612}{2685}- setting its spirit free.
{2736}{2885}Colonel Ludlow had three sons,|but Tristan was his favourite.
{2889}{2978}l'd had sons, too ...
{2982}{3092}But they were gone now ... Forever.
{3098}{3166}lt was a very bad time.
{3174}{3304}The Colonel had tried|to help the people.
{3308}{3391}But it was no use.
{3395}{3523}So he decided to go his own way.
{3536}{3632}He wanted to lose the madness|over the mountains, he said.
{3643}{3727}Begin again.
{3869}{3948}Lose the madness, he said ...
{3952}{4115}And so we lived for many years,|and the boys grew strong.
{4290}{4453}Alfred was the older brother,|old even for his years.
{4457}{4531}Samuel was the youngest.
{4535}{4619}There was nothing these brothers|would not do for him.
{4623}{4714}They watched over him|like a treasure.
{4718}{4839}One year ... l am an old man,|l cannot remember the year.
{4843}{4915}lt was the moon of the red grass.
{4919}{5035}lsabel Ludlow, their mother,|went away for the winter.
{5039}{5128}She said the winters|were too cruel for her.
{5132}{5224}She said she was|afraid of the bears.
{5228}{5317}She was a strange woman, anyway.
{5623}{5736}That spring, though,|she did not retum.
{5755}{5878}And after that. she did not|come much to see us.
{5882}{6031}Alfred wrote her many letters,|but Tristan refused to speak of her.
{6035}{6142}His world was here ... with me.
{6187}{6295}Every warrior hopes|a good death will find him.
{6299}{6466}But Tristan couldn 't wait.|He went looking for his.
{8296}{8390}Tristan! Tristan!
{8454}{8550}- Was it a bear?|- Yes, sir
{8554}{8664}Can you breathe?|Take your hand away
{8687}{8790}You're a stupid,|half-bred jackass
{8808}{8896}Did One Stab put you up to this?
{8900}{9050}You deserve to be dead|God knows how you've lived so long
{9497}{9606}l have these letters.
{9630}{9695}Read them.
{9699}{9877}They are from all of them.|Ludlow ... lsabel ... Samuel.
{9904}{10002}The whole family. The whole story.
{10006}{10081}lt is all written here.
{10109}{10191}April 13th, 1913.
{10195}{10328}Dear lsabel, l am not fool enough to|try to alter a life already lived.
{10341}{10474}But l feel l have not done well|raising our sons in this wild place.
{10478}{10589}What did l know of children?|l was trained to lead men.
{10593}{10671}This is infinitely harder.
{10675}{10796}Dear William, you take too much|responsibility on yourself.
{10800}{10935}Our sons can find their own paths.|They are willful, certainly, -
{10939}{11022}- but who are we|to complain of willfulness.
{11026}{11127}l have news of Samuel.|At a Harvard tea -
{11131}{11223}- he met Miss Susannah Finncannon.
{11227}{11358}l know it will surprise you greatly,|but they are engaged.
{11362}{11484}This summer he will bring her|to Montana to meet you all.
{11488}{11645}So behave yourself and be|as charming as only you can be.
{11717}{11788}There he is
{11857}{11952}- How the hell are you?|- Good, and you?
{11988}{12083}Samuel Good to see you, boy
{12177}{12295}Father,|this is my fiancee Susannah

{13008}{13087}- He's just plain old Alfred|- Shut up

{13191}{13319}He'll be here tonight,|or I'll know the reason why
{13323}{13452}Miss Finncannon, please|Did you have a good journey?
{13523}{13609}She is a lovely creature, William, -
{13613}{13720}- but she has a certain fragility|after the loss of herparents.
{13724}{13831}At times l think she feels|very alone in the world.
{13835}{13916}But she has found a new family now.
{13920}{13990}The German military is ready
{13994}{14084}The entire civilized world|could be plunged into 
{14088}{14192}The word ''civilized'' has no place|in the affairs of this world
{14196}{14332}Our mother has told us of your|sympathy for the social reformers
{14336}{14444}- You make it sound like a disease|- No, l'm in agreement
{14448}{14559}Your mother told me of One Stab|She said he was a great warrior
{14563}{14704}He has a bag of scalps somewhere|to prove it, but don't worry, -
{14708}{14810}- he and father|are devoted to each other now
{14814}{14900}- Can he speak English?|- Stab? Speak English?
{14904}{15018}He wouldn't lower himself|to speak English Would you, Stab?
{15022}{15128}But watch out,|he understands it perfectly well
{15143}{15223}Hey, there's Tristan
{15664}{15779}- Don't they feed you up there?|- Not much
{15877}{15956}- You smell|- Miss me, did you?
{15960}{16089}- Still hungover?|- Still drunk
{16108}{16177}lsn't she amazing?
{16181}{16255}So this is Tristan
{16287}{16375}And does he speak English?
{16725}{16814}Miss Finncannon,|it's a pleasure to meet you
{16818}{16955}l hope you and ugly here|find every happiness together

{50765}{50859}Nothing is as l thought.
{50909}{51026}Tonight. as l prayed for the souls|of those who 've died so terribly, -
{51030}{51105}- l also prayed forpersonal glory.
{51109}{51247}ls it wrong to want to distinguish|myself in combat. as my father did?

{52030}{52142}- Are you hit?|- lt's just a scratch

{55055}{55147}Please stay on at the ranch|and wait for me.
{55151}{55219}Don 't let Father worry.
{55223}{55319}God will protect me,|aided considerably by Tristan.

{70801}{70901}Susannah was to retum to Boston|on the moming train.
{70905}{71025}But a norther blew for three days,|and snow drifted over the tracks.
{71029}{71159}The Colonel insisted|she stay on until spring.
{71168}{71273}The house was too empty, he said.
{71281}{71387}This was still her home,|he told her.
{71413}{71485}He should have let her go.
{71489}{71617}But how could he have known|what would happen?
{71670}{71746}She was not to blame.
{71750}{71910}She was like the water that freezes|in the rock and splits it apart.
